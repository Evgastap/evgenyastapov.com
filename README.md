If you check my commits, I've messed around with React a fair bit. I feel that I'm comfortable enough with it to make own site, for real this time.

## Packages used

- [`tailwind.css`](https://tailwindcss.com/) - because who likes regular CSS
- [`framer-motion`](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - animations are cool
- [`react-typical`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typical) - for re-usable typing animation
- [`react-progressive-image`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-progressive-image) - for loading the front page image as fast as possible, and swapping when full-res get loaded
- [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) - because pretty code
- `typescript` - because starting without typescript and converting the entire project to TS half-way though is the best kind of fun

## TODOs:
- Home animation: when card is clicked, first fade all the other cards away before zooming in on the new page
- Subset fonts to only used characters
- Lazy load & animate image cards on `/photography`
